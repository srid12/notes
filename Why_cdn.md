A CDN is system of distributed servers that delivers web content to users based on their geographic location , origin of webpage and server of CDN. Here are some of its primary usecases
1. Speed:-  CDNs deliver content more quickly by caching it at various points in a network. This shortens the distance between the user and the server, reducing latency and improving site render speed.

2. Reduced Bandwidth Costs: - Through caching and other optimizations, CDNs can reduce the amount of data an origin server must provide, thereby reducing hosting costs for website owners

3. Increased Reliability and Availability: - By distributing content across multiple geographically dispersed servers, CDNs can handle more traffic and withstand hardware failure better than many origin servers.


4. Security: CDNs also offer improved security measures, such as DDoS protection. By recognizing and absorbing malicious traffic before it reaches the origin server, CDNs can ensure service availability even under attack
5. Improving User Experience: By delivering content faster, CDNs help to improve the overall user experience, which could lead to higher engagement rates, longer on-site times, lower bounce rates, and even increased conversion rates in some cases.
